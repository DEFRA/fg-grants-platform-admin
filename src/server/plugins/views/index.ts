/**
 * Everything a views manager needs apart from where its pages live and which
 * nunjucks environment resolves what they pull in. A domain spreads the result
 * into its own `server.views()` call, adding `relativeTo` and `path`, so
 * vision resolves `h.view('index')` against that domain's directory — a
 * handler never names a path through the source tree, and this file never
 * names a domain.
 *
 * The environment is a parameter because it is the seam between design
 * systems: GDS domains share the environment from ./engine.ts, while a domain
 * that is effectively its own app (dev-ops) brings an environment that
 * cannot even resolve a GDS template, so a stray govuk import fails at render
 * instead of silently working.
